# Software Engineneering Immersive: Project 2
This was my second project during the sixth week of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. It was part of a two-days long design-sprint like "Reactathon" and it was made in collaboration with Aleksandra Skoczylas (https://github.com/leealex88).
